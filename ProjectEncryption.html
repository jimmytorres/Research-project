    <h3>Encryption description</h3> 
    <p>What is encryption? Encryption is the process of turning readable information into an encoded version that is only readable to authorized users. In order to decrypt the information users must  have an encryption key to view all the information. Encryption is a method of keeping your data protected and more secure. Basic forms of encryption is known as a password. The strength of an encryption depends on the length of a password.

    <h3>Who Started This?</h3>
    <p>The idea of encryption came from cryptography which Leon Battista ALberti created. Computer scientists started to encrypt data which are also known as passwords. They did this with the intent of keeping data safe and private.

    <h3>Why does encryption exist? What do you gain from it?</h3>
    <p>Encryption exist because the purpose of it is that it keeps all of our personal information more protected and doesn't allow unwanted people to steal all of your information and use it for the wrong things. What do you gain from encryption. Well you gain more security on your most private information. It also makes more secure servers for a group project.</p>

    <h3>Four Interesting facts on Encryption</h3> 
    <p>Encryption comes in two forms, symmetrical and asymmetrical. A symmetrical encryption is encrypted data that can be locked or unlocked by only one key. An asymmetrical encryption has a public key to encrypt the data and a private key to unlock the data. Asymmetrical encryption is the strongest type. The strength of an encryption depends on the length of the encryption.

    <h3>Examples</h3> 
    <p>Communication- having private conversation with other people.</p>
<p>Digital certificates- A company publishes their name on the website they own and encryption will keep your company certified. </p>
<p>Authentication-making sure of the identity of the user or object.</p>
<p>Devices- phones are designed to have encryption on there storage by default.</p>

    <h3>How does this affect coding or online culture</h3> 
    <p>In online culture this has kept everyone's private information safe from other online users. It also keeps their devices safe and secure from the publicâ€™s eyes. In coding culture this can keep files for a secret project safe from other users from seeing it.
